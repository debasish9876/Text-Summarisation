Text Summarization using Natural Language Processing
Welcome to the Text Summarization using Natural Language Processing project! Text summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing, enabling users to distill large volumes of text into concise and informative summaries. Whether you're dealing with lengthy articles, research papers, or documents, this project provides a powerful solution for generating accurate and meaningful summaries automatically.

The Text Summarization system employs advanced natural language processing techniques to extract key information from the input text and condense it into a summary while preserving the most important details. It supports both extractive and abstractive summarization methods, giving you the flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your needs.

To get started, ensure you have a basic understanding of natural language processing concepts and techniques. Clone the repository, and you'll find everything you need to set up the text summarization system. The project includes algorithms and models for text processing, as well as evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated summaries.

Configure the system by specifying the input text and desired length of the summary. You can then run the text summarization algorithm and evaluate the results against reference summaries if available. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to integrate custom models or algorithms as needed.

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving the summarization algorithms, optimizing performance, or adding support for new languages, we encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
